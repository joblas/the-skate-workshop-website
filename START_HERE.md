## 📋 Verify It's Working

### Check DNS Propagation:
Visit: https://dnschecker.org  
Enter: `theskateworkshop.app`  
Should show Vercel's IP spreading worldwide

### Test Your Site:
Once DNS propagates, visit:
- https://theskateworkshop.app
- https://www.theskateworkshop.app

Both should show your website with SSL (🔒 lock icon)!
