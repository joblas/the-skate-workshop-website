## 🎨 Formatting in the Document

The markdown uses these symbols:

- `#` - Main page headers (don't change these)
- `##` - Section headers (don't change these)
- `###` - Subsection headers (don't change these)
- `**text**` - Bold text (shows up bold on website)
- `-` - Bullet points
- `[Text](url)` - Links

You can edit what's between the symbols, but keep the symbols intact!
