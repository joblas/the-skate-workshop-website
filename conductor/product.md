# Product Guide - The Skate Workshop Website

## Initial Concept
The Skate Workshop website is the digital storefront and marketing hub for an elite skateboarding coaching platform. It features Olympic-level coach Willy Santos and serves as the bridge to a custom mobile coaching application (developed separately) that provides world-class video analysis, athlete tracking, and training management.

## Project Focus
The project is currently in a pre-launch phase, focusing on:
*   **Maintenance & Stability:** Ensuring the production-ready v1.0.0 release is robust.
*   **Pre-Launch Refinement:** Optimizing the "Coming Soon" features and email waitlist conversion to build momentum for the mobile app launch.
*   **Beta Testing:** Supporting the current Beta test phase with Willy and a select group of athletes on iOS, and distributing the Android APK.

## Target Audience
*   **Aspiring Skateboarders:** Athletes seeking high-level coaching to improve their skills.
*   **Professional Coaches:** Elite trainers looking to join a premier coaching ecosystem.
*   **Willy Santos Community:** Existing followers of Willy's Workshop and the broader skateboarding ecosystem.
*   **Proof-of-Concept Athletes:** Current top-tier athletes used to demonstrate Willy's world-class coaching methodology.

## Strategic Goals
*   **Establish Authority:** Prove Willy's status as a world-leading Olympic coach through high-quality content and athlete success stories.
*   **Platform Validation:** Demonstrate the capabilities of the upcoming mobile tool (Video Analysis, Private Athlete Spaces, Training Plans) to encourage adoption.
*   **Ecosystem Growth:** Drive waitlist sign-ups for athletes and recruitment applications for new coaches.
*   **Competitive Positioning:** Position The Skate Workshop as the "best in the world" alternative to generic coaching tools, specifically tailored for the needs of elite skateboarding.

## Conversion Objectives
1.  **Waitlist Acquisition:** Capture high-intent users for the mobile app launch.
2.  **Coach Applications:** Build a roster of elite coaching talent.
3.  **Trust & Credibility:** Deepen user engagement with Willy's credentials and the platform's vision.
