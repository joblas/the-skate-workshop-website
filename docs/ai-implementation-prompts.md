   - Smooth spring animation
   - Use transform: rotateX() and rotateY()
5. Hover state animations:
   - Card lifts up 8px (translateY(-8px))
   - Shadow intensifies (from subtle to prominent glow)
   - Border color shifts to brand-red with 50% opacity
6. Icon (emoji) at top should:
   - Be large (text-4xl or 5xl)
   - Animate on card hover: scale 1.1 + rotate 5deg
   - Smooth spring transition
7. Title should be bold, white text, 1.25rem

```

VISUAL STYLE:
- Dark glassmorphic cards (gray-900 with transparency)
- Subtle borders and shadows
- Brand red accents for highlighted cards
- Clean typography with hierarchy
- Emojis as visual anchors

STRICT SCOPE:
- Create `src/components/FeatureCard.tsx`
- Update `src/app/page.tsx` to use the cards in a grid

TECH STACK CONTEXT:
- Framework: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Animation: Framer Motion 11.0 + Intersection Observer
- Component: Reusable counter component

DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create reusable counter component at `src/components/AnimatedCounter.tsx`
2. Accept props: target (number), suffix (string), prefix (string), duration (ms)
3. Use Intersection Observer to detect when counter enters viewport
4. When visible, animate from 0 to target value using easing curve
5. Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth counting animation
6. Support prefixes like "$" and suffixes like "+ Years", "K"
7. Create section component at `src/components/StatsSection.tsx`
8. Section should display 3-4 statistics in a grid:
   - "30+ Years of Coaching"
   - "500+ Athletes Trained"
   - "10 Olympic/X-Games Medalists"
   - "$200+ Avg. Session Rate"
9. Each stat should have:

   - Label below in smaller, gray text
   - Icon or emoji above number
10. Grid layout: 2 columns mobile, 4 columns desktop
11. Background: Dark section (bg-gray-900 or black)
12. Section appears with fade-in animation on scroll
13. Counter should only animate once (not on every scroll)

CODE EXAMPLES & CONSTRAINTS:
```tsx
// AnimatedCounter.tsx interface
interface AnimatedCounterProps {
  target: number;
  duration?: number;
  suffix?: string;
  prefix?: string;
  decimals?: number;
}

// Animation logic (simplified)
useEffect(() => {
  if (!inView) return;

  const startTime = performance.now();
  const animate = (currentTime: number) => {
    const elapsed = currentTime - startTime;
    const progress = Math.min(elapsed / duration, 1);

    // Easing function (ease-out)
    const easeOut = 1 - Math.pow(1 - progress, 3);
    const current = Math.floor(easeOut * target);

    setValue(current);

    if (progress < 1) {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
  };

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}, [inView]);

// Usage in StatsSection
<AnimatedCounter target={30} suffix="+ Years" />
```

VISUAL STYLE:
- Dark background section
- Large, bold numbers in white
- Labels in gray-400
- Icons/emojis for visual interest
- Generous spacing between stats

STRICT SCOPE:
- Create `src/components/AnimatedCounter.tsx`
- Create `src/components/StatsSection.tsx`
- Replace existing StatsSection in homepage
- Do NOT modify other components

ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Screen readers should read final value (not animated count)
- Use aria-label with final value on counter element
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion (show final value immediately)
- Proper semantic HTML (section, headings)

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use requestAnimationFrame for 60fps animation
- Cancel animation if component unmounts
- Intersection Observer with margin to trigger slightly before visible
- Only animate once (track in state to prevent re-animation)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Two TypeScript components with full typing
- Smooth easing curve for natural animation
- Responsive grid layout
- Clean, reusable code
- Example usage in comments
